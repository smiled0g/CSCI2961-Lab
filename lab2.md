### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
Licensing lets developers of a software control the rights for other parties to distribute and use of it, as well as to protect their intellectual property. For example, in order to keep the **derivative software** to remain **free** (as in freedom), ones may place *copyleft license* on their software. This makes sure that the original piece of software **not end up being used by nonfree (without copyleft) software**, which can be used to preserve the ideology of free software. Otherwise, ones may use *permissive license*, which only requires that the developers of the original software being attributed in code or documentation, and a little more.

### Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license
Without license, a software is protected by copyright law, which prevent them from using, modifying, and distributing of the software. Since the developers have not yet grant permissions for others to have any right to use their software, it is *illegal (I may be wrong on this)* for anyone to do anything with it.
