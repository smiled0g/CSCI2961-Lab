In my opinion, the problem lied in America's law system more than anything else. With the required expense to fight in court, any giant in any industry could bully practically anyone they want. In this case, what RIAA did was, at least to me, shameless, in the sense that it targeted students who are encouraged to make a lot of mistakes in the, presumably, safe space of college. The institutions should have helped the students fight to stop the lawsuits from taking their entire savings. Money aside, the more important thing that the institutions should have fought for was the space where the students can be tinkering and experimenting with new ideas. Nonetheless, this incident showed that there was something seriously wrong with law system, and how people fought for getting justice collectively as a society.
